** This repo is used as config by NvChad user **

Updating my vim config. Things are so large I pulled it out of my dotfiles directory.

I used nvchad as the base so I could get things off the ground quickly.

**This repo is supposed to used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)
